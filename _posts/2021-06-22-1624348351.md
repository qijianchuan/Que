首先到官网下载需要的包：http://www.keepalived.org/download.html  

    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang local]# tar -zxvf /tmp/keepalived-1.3.5.tar.gz 
    [root@liuyazhuang local]# cd keepalived-1.3.5/
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/keepalived

然后系统出现警告：  

    
    
    *** WARNING - this build will not support IPVS with IPv6. Please install libnl/libnl-3 dev libraries to support IPv6 with IPVS.
    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# yum -y install libnl libnl-devel

安装完以后重新执行configure

    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/keepalived

这次出现错误：  

    
    
    configure: error: libnfnetlink headers missing
    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# yum install -y libnfnetlink-devel

重新执行configure  

    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/keepalived

现在进行编译：  

    
    
    [root@liuyazhuang keepalived-1.3.5]# make && make install

问题解决了。
